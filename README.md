-- GITHUB COMMANDS -- 

(1) git checkout-b "branch name" --> creating/switching to the branch you want to commit/push

(2) git add . --> Adds all files in your current directory. Replace the . with the specific file (e.g., Nurse.java) to only add that single file
(3) git commit -m "insert message/description" --> saves the current state of all your files in the directory. You can add a message (short description) of changes you made in your files
($) git push origin "insert branch name" --> Please push first into your own branch. Push means submitting your files in this repository

After doing Steps 1 - 5, Create a pull request here in github website (in our repository). With that, all members can review the edited 
files you pushed and decide wether to merge it in the main branch. The main branch should always be working, no error, and final.
